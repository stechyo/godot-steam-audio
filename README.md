# What is this?
This is an implementation of Steam Audio in Godot, being frankenstiened into a tech demo for what Space Station 14 could sound like with Steam Audio implemented.

The readme of the godot project from whence it has been forked is as follows:
## godot-steam-audio
This is a GDExtension that integrates the [steam-audio](https://valvesoftware.github.io/steam-audio/) library
into Godot 4.4. This adds sound effects such as occlusion and reverb into the engine.

This extension has been created and maintained by me (@stechyo), but due to a lack of time/interest in game
development in the past year this is not really being maintained/developed at the rate it could be. I am, of
course, extremely thankful to all of the people who have opened issues and PRs, starred the project or
generally taken an interest in it. If anyone is interested in maintaining the project, feel free to fork it.
If you have any questions about the code/architecture, email me or DM me on Twitter at any time.

SteamAudio is a library made by Valve that improves aural immersion in games by adding effects such as
rotational and positional tracking and real-time sound propagation (occlusion and reflection). It is used in
[many games](https://steamdb.info/tech/SDK/Steam_Audio/), such as Counter-Strike 2 and Half-Life: Alyx, and
Valve offers [official plugins](https://valvesoftware.github.io/steam-audio/downloads.html) for Unity, Unreal,
and FMOD. This Godot extension is an unofficial plugin, but our end-goal is to offer the same features and
allow Godot devs to use them in their games. This extension is open-source and
MIT-licensed, while SteamAudio is Apache-licensed (but still open-source), as
per its [license](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-audio/blob/master/LICENSE.md). Please note that
SteamAudio does use proprietary libraries, and to get a fully open-source extension you'll need to explicitly
compile everything by yourself to choose not to include them.

This extension is in an alpha phase, will have bugs and missing polish, and may crash. Don't expect to be able
to ship a game with this extension right now unless you are ready to make some fixes/optimizations to it on
your own (and if you do, PRs are accepted). Linux and Windows are currently working. Mac probably works, but I
don't have the time nor the money to support that, sorry.

### Features 
 - Spatial ambisonics audio 
 - Occlusion and transmission through geometry 
 - Distance attenuation
 - Reflections (reverb)
 - Dynamic geometry

 To come: 
 - More editor configuration
 - Baked scenes for higher-performance reflections
 - More raycasting support

### Getting started
Check [Installation](https://github.com/stechyo/godot-steam-audio/wiki/Installation) for how to install the extension, [Project setup](https://github.com/stechyo/godot-steam-audio/wiki/Project-setup) for how to integrate it with your project, and [Contributing](https://github.com/stechyo/godot-steam-audio/wiki/Contributing) if you're interested in improving the extension.
