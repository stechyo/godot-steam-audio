		Static geometry that will affect SteamAudio simulation.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
        This node will attempt to get a mesh from its parent at [code]_ready()[/code] and add it to the internal SteamAudio scene. Adding a node after the game has started probably works, but it is not supported. If you want to move this node's transform at runtime, use [code]recalculate()[/code] or consider (if you want more detailed simulation and don't mind worse performance) [SteamAudioDynamicGeometry].
		This node can extract meshes from the following nodes:
		- [MeshInstance3D]
		- [CollisionShape3D], [b]if its shape is one of[/b]:
			- [BoxShape3D]
			- [CylinderShape3D]
			- [CapsuleShape3D]
			- [SphereShape3D]
			- [ConcavePolygonShape3D]

                Changes the internal SteamAudio scene to reflect any changes in transform that you may have made to the object. If you plan on calling this every frame to account for an object's motion, it's probably better to use [SteamAudioDynamicGeometry].
