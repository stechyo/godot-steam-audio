		Dynamic geometry that will affect SteamAudio simulation.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
        This node will attempt to get a mesh from its parent at [code]_ready()[/code] and add it to the internal SteamAudio scene. Adding a node after the game has started probably works, but it is not supported. If this object isn't going to move, then just use [SteamAudioGeometry].

		This node can extract meshes from the following nodes:
		- [MeshInstance3D]
		- [CollisionShape3D], [b]if its shape is one of[/b]:
			- [BoxShape3D]
			- [CylinderShape3D]
			- [CapsuleShape3D]
			- [SphereShape3D]
			- [ConcavePolygonShape3D]
